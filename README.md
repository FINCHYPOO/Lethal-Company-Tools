Behold my first python project I know the GUI looks awful but i'll probably still use it. Here is a Chat GPT summary of that is in the code

ChatGPT Summary:
The purpose of this code is to create a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter for looking up information about
different moons associated with a fictional entity called "Lethal Company." The user can select a moon from a dropdown menu,
and upon clicking the "Submit" button, the code retrieves and displays details such as the minimum loot and loot density for
the selected moon. The GUI provides additional descriptions for terms like "Minimum Loot," "Item Density," and 
"Map Size Multiplier" to offer users a better understanding of the displayed information. In case of errors or if the selected 
moon is not found in the data, appropriate error messages are displayed using Tkinter's messagebox. The overall purpose is to
provide a user-friendly way to explore and understand specific details related to various moons associated with Lethal Company.
